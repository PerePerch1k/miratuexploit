## Roblox Lua Executor
## Attention!: (The Lua Executor is only for Educational Purposes. Please do not imitate.)
### What is a Roblox Lua Executor?  
This executor is made for executing Lua scripts into Roblox processes.  
## How do i use it?
So for using this executor, first of all what you need to do is:  
1. Download or copy the repository
2. Open the code in vscode
3. Change the ```lua_code = "print('Hello, Roblox!')"``` To whatever lua code you want to execute
4. Open roblox, join experience
5. Open the python file
6. Enjoy!
## What to do if you got error "Failed to read Lua state address"?
The "Failed to read Lua state address" error typically occurs when the Lua executor is unable to access the Lua state address from the Roblox process.   
This can happen due to various reasons such as:
1. **Roblox process not found**: Make sure that the Roblox process is running and the executor is able to find it.  
2. **Insufficient permissions**: Ensure that the executor has the necessary permissions to read the Lua state address from the Roblox process.  
3. **Lua state address not valid**: Verify that the Lua state address being used is correct and valid.    
### To resolve this issue, you can try the following:  
1. **Check the Roblox process**: Ensure that the Roblox process is running and the executor is able to find it.  
2. **Verify Lua state address**: Double-check that the Lua state address being used is correct and valid.  
3. **Run the executor with elevated permissions**: Try running the executor with administrator privileges to ensure that it has the necessary permissions to access the Lua state address.  
4. **Check for any antivirus or firewall restrictions**: Antivirus or firewall software may be blocking the executor from accessing the Lua state address. Try temporarily disabling these restrictions to see if it resolves the issue.  
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Failed to read Lua state address" error and get your Lua executor up and running.  
## What permissions are needed for the Lua executor?
The Lua executor requires certain permissions to access the Roblox process and read the Lua state address. Here are some of the permissions that may be required:
1. **ReadProcessMemory**: This permission allows the executor to read the memory of the Roblox process, which is necessary to access the Lua state address.
2. **WriteProcessMemory**: This permission allows the executor to write to the memory of the Roblox process, which may be necessary to execute Lua code.
3. **OpenProcess**: This permission allows the executor to open a handle to the Roblox process, which is necessary to access its memory.
4. **PROCESS_VM_READ**: This permission allows the executor to read the virtual memory of the Roblox process.
5. **PROCESS_VM_WRITE**: This permission allows the executor to write to the virtual memory of the Roblox process.
6. **PROCESS_VM_OPERATION**: This permission allows the executor to perform operations on the virtual memory of the Roblox process.
### To grant these permissions, you may need to:
1. **Run the executor as an administrator**: Right-click the executor executable and select "Run as administrator" to grant elevated permissions.
2. **Use the SeDebugPrivilege privilege**: This privilege allows the executor to debug and access the memory of other processes. You can enable this privilege using the AdjustTokenPrivileges function.
3. **Use the OpenProcess function with the PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS flag**: This flag grants the executor all possible permissions to access the Roblox process.
Here's an example of how to use the OpenProcess function with the PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS flag:  
```roblox_process_handle = ctypes.windll.kernel32.OpenProcess(0x1F0FFF, False, roblox_process_id)```  
Note that granting these permissions can be a security risk, as it allows the executor to access and modify the memory of other processes. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that the executor is trusted and secure.  
Also, keep in mind that Roblox may have anti-cheat measures in place to detect and prevent unauthorized access to their process. Using a Lua executor to access the Roblox process may be against their terms of service and could result in account bans or other penalties.
## Can i get banned for using it?
Yes, you can get banned for using a Lua executor. The executor allows you to execute Lua scripts in the Roblox process, which can be considered cheating or exploiting. Roblox has anti-cheat measures in place to detect and prevent unauthorized access to their process, and using a Lua executor may be against their terms of service. If you're caught using a Lua executor, you may face penalties, including account bans.
## What are the consequences of getting banned for using a Lua executor?
If you get banned for using a Lua executor, the consequences can be severe and may include:  
### Account Suspension or Ban
You may lose all your progress, including game progress, items, and currency.  
Your assets, such as games, models, and other creations, may be deleted or removed from the platform.  
### Reputation Damage
Your reputation in the Roblox community may be damaged, making it harder to collaborate with others or participate in games and events.  
You may be labeled as a cheater or exploiter, which can lead to social ostracism.  
### IP Ban
Your IP address may be banned, which means you won't be able to access Roblox services from that IP address.  
This can be problematic if you share an IP address with others, as they may also be affected.  
### Hardware Ban
In extreme cases, your hardware may be banned, which means you won't be able to access Roblox services from that device.  
This can be a significant issue if you use the same device for other purposes.  
### Legal Consequences
In some cases, Roblox may take legal action against users who violate their terms of service, including those who use Lua executors.  
You may face legal consequences, such as fines or lawsuits, depending on the severity of the violation.  

It's essential to remember that using a Lua executor is against Roblox's terms of service, and the consequences can be severe. It's always best to play fair and follow the rules to avoid any penalties.
